To run the app in a development environment, run
$ ionic serve --configuration=development
This is because for some reason, our configuration does not recognize our 
development environment, so it defaults to production. This allows us to see 
more useful error messages while developing, as well as faster compile times, as 
the application no longer needs to optimize the code, only serve it.
