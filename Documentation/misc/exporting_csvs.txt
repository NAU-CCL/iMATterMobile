Sometimes wwe want to use data from the database so we need a way to extract it. There may be easier ways, but this is the first way I found that does it.

We're going to be using firestore-export a tool that allows us to query a collection on firebase and get the result as a json. I reccoment running:
firestore-export -h 
to learn more about what we're doing and not just copying the code. 

Create an access key:
1. Go to the firebase main page, then navigate to the settings
2. Under the "Service Accounts" tab, click the "Generate new private key button"
3. Click the confirmation to generate and download the data 
4. Ensure to store this private key in a secure repo, as it allows anyone to access the database

Downloading the Package: 
1. run: 
    sudo npm i -g node-firestore-import-export 

Using the package:
1. run firestore-export -a /path/to/private/key -b /path/to/save/extracted/date.json -n /name/of/firebase/collection -p 

 as an example: firestore-export -a /home/koseward/Downloads/databaseExport.json -b ../backupUsersPointsRedeem.json -n usersPointsRedeem -p

Lets talk about these flags:
-a is the path for the private key we downloaded
-b is the path that you want to save the extracted data to, and it must have a .json ending
-n the collection in the firebase database, must be a collection and not just one document
-p displays the json in human readable format, not strictly neccesary

Converting to CSV:
1. use any onlince converter to change data from json to CSV
