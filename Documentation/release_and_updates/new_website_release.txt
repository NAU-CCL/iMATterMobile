When editing the website, it will need to be released when done. 
This will be the list of commands and what they do to release new versions of the website.
Note: do not run this in the iMATterMobile directory, only in the iMATterWeb one.
Note: Only deploy the master branch of the web application to ensure that fewer bugs make it to production

1. First, make sure the website is working by testing locally:
$ ionic serve 

2. Build the release version of the application:
$ ionic build --prod --release 

This generates the www folder for the website

3. Deploy the website with:
$ firebase deploy --only hosting
