This will describe how to edit or update firebase functions.
Firebase functions are like our backend - they manage our database to ensure 
that there is consistency and that certain updates will happen. This documentation
describes how to push changes to functions to firebase.

1. To change functions, look in the functions directory and change or add functions
    in the index.js file. 

2. Once done, the changed function can be deployed with:
$ firebase deploy --only name_of_function_deployed

3. If many functions were changed, you can run the command above multiple times or run:
$ firebase deploy
