This will allow us to create a set of apks for testing an app bundle.
This creates the same product as what is downdloaded from the google play store.

One thing to note, however, is to never include these files in git. 
.apks expose a debug version of the app that can show attackers the passwords that
we use to access for example, firestore. It is a good idea to delete a set of .apks
once the testing with them is done. 

1. Build the app bundle 
    $ ionic cordova build android --release
    ^ You can also omit the --release flag for testing
    $ cd platforms/android
    $ ./gradlew build

2.  Build the set of .apks
    $ bundletool build-apks --bundle=app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --output=../../testiMATter.apks
    ^ if release tag was ommited, instead of bundle/relase, look in bundle/debug

3. Installing the .apks
    Ensure there is a device connected
    $ adb devices

    On the actual device, ensure that iMATter is not installed and that it is removed from the app trash

    Install onto the device
    $ cd -
    $ bundletool install-apks --apks=testiMATter.apks
