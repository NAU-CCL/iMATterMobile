The following commands build a new version of the application.
By the end, there will be a signed version of the application that can be uploaded
right to the google play store. 

First, let's make sure we will be able to upload this version. 
If needed, go to the google play console, and go to the latest release of the application.


ionic cordova build --release android

cd platforms/android

./gradlew build 

cd -

jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore platforms/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab alias_name

mv platforms/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab ./iMATter_V5.6.0.aab

all done!
